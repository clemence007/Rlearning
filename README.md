R language learning notes

Hello, I'm a chinese student of collage and want to learn biostatistic for my graduate program.

So I'm recording my notes of basic arguments and package.

If you also love biostatistics or find any questions about my notes or even love chinese culture, you can email me or just write something in Issue. 

Every mistake you point out is a treature for me!
