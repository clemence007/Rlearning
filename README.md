# Rlearning

Hello visitors, this is Chaoqun's learning notes of programming language R.

I document my notes of arguments and package of R in dorder to review them quickly. So if your are also learning R, we can help each other and make progresses together.

Also, if you find any questions or mistakes in my notes, please write something in Issue or email me. Whatever you point out must be a treature for me!

Maybe you find I'm Chinese from my name, so if you are curious about chinese culture or anything anout China, why not contact  me? I love introducing my country to people worldwide and communicating with others~ I sometimes update my reading blogs in manderin, and this is my website : http://www.xcqblog.com
